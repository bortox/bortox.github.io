description: "Andrea Bortolotti's website containing school projects on homework and notes as well as articles on computers and technology."

The site ( the lair of the Borto) is divided into two sections: 
* Person :neutral_face: 
* School :school_satchel:

{{< alert >}}
I want to make this website multilingual (Italian and English) but it will take a while to translate everything, for best experience set Italian language clicking on :it: on the top left :/

## :neutral_face: Person

### Photo :camera:

The **personal section** contains a [collection of :camera:](https://bortox.it/galleria) photos taken by me. Photography has always interested me, and I've had several compact cameras since primary schools.

### Blog ðŸ’»

The [computer blog]() instead contains guides and notes to improve the experience of using various Linux ðŸ’» and Android ðŸ“± distros. I use Arch, btw_.

## :school_satchel: School

### Homework and school notes :memo:

The school section contains the site _[Homework and school notes](https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici)_, a growing collection of all the notes I took in high school although I update it less lately because I have less time. The site can be found in Google results and contains over 100 posts. The most visited ones remain the Latin Versions, because - between you and me - who translates the vocabulary versions from Latin without ever copying them online?

If you'd like to contribute - code, knowledge or money - to _Tasks and School Notes_ you can see the options available at [contribute-cs](https://bortox.it/contribuisci-cs/)

### Latin Paradigm Finder

[:mag: Trovaparadigmi GUI](https://bortox.it/trovaparadigmi) is a Windows program written in Python to quickly and easily compile a complete list of paradigms in a version of Latin.

I wrote the program initially for myself, then made some improvements and distributed an .exe file to my classmates, with the aim of _providing everyone with a more or less accurate option to quickly find the paradigms of an entire Latin version, and save them in a text document_.

### PCTO Environmental Monitoring :telescope:

A new addition to the school section is instead [PCTO Environmental Monitoring](). The PCTO is a physics course in collaboration with the CNR on climate change and environmental monitoring using spectroscopy.
