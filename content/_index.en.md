The nest branches in two main sections, a didactic one and a personal one.

:school: In High School, I shared [improved web versions of my notes]({{< ref "/compiti" >}}) to help fellow students. In Italian, the [site :it:](https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici/) - particularly the Latin section - has gained quite some views (>200k) and I also wrote a program, [*Latin Paradigm Finder* :it:](https://bortox.it/trovaparadigmi/) to extract verb paradigms from a latin text.

:people_hugging: I also keep a [:camera: personal collection of photos :it:](https://bortox.it/galleria) as I enjoy taking pictures and editing them. Once in a while, I'll write something tech-related on my [:man_technologist: blog ]({{< ref "/article" >}}).

Thank you for your visit :clap: I hope *bortox.it* proves useful.
