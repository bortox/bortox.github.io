## Projects

### Compiti Scolastici


[Web portal](https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici/) developed and managed independtly to freely distribute high quality school notes to italian students. Started as a single github repo for chemistry homework, regularly updated for all notes, now it counts almost **500 000 views** :tada:. The project is entirely based in Europe (domain, DNS, analytics, hosting) and does not track or profit off users. Sustainability is also a main focus: by employing modern data compression techniques and sustainable hosting, the website places on the [top 6% for CO2 emissions](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/bortox-it/). You can read more about it [here]({{< ref "/about-website/#eco-sustainability-deciduous_tree" >}})

### Other

- **Latin Paradigm Finder**, Python desktop application with an interactive GUI designed to automate the verb analysis of latin texts list (Personal Project)
- [**Photography Digital Garden**](https://fotografia.bortox.it/): Website showcasing the history of photography and popular works (Group project in Italian)

## Photography

Since elementary school i fiddled with portable cameras. First Nintendo DS and old Nokias, then compact, bridge, reflex and now mirrorless cameras. I like taking portraits but for privacy reasons don't publish them, so you'll find [architecture, abstract, nature photography on bortox.eu](https://bortox.eu).
