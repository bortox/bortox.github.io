## Website map
The site (the lair of the Borto) is divided into two sections: 
* Person :neutral_face: 
* School :school_satchel:

---
### :neutral_face: Person

#### Photo :camera:

The **personal section** contains a [collection of :camera:](https://bortox.eu) photos taken by me. Photography has always interested me, and I've had several compact cameras since primary schools.

#### Blog 💻

The [computer blog (:it:,:uk:)]({{< ref "/article" >}}) instead contains guides and notes to improve the experience of using various Linux 💻 and Android 📱 distros. 

---
### :school_satchel: School

#### Homework and school notes :memo:

The school section contains the site [Compiti Scolastici (:it:)](https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici), a growing collection of all the notes I took in high school although I update it much less lately because I have less time. 

The site can be found in Google results and contains over 100 posts. The most visited ones remain the Latin Versions, because - between you and me - who translates versions from Latin using only the vocabulary without even copying a little bit online?
Honestly - now in 2026 is sad that people just use ChatGPT without even copying data.


If you'd like to contribute - code, knowledge or money - to Compiti Scolastici you can see the options available at [contribute-cs](https://bortox.it/contribuisci-cs/)

## Eco-sustainability :deciduous_tree:

A visit to bortox produces just **0.02** grams of CO<sub>2</sub> - cleaner than 98% of sites tested - and the server uses sustainable energy!

<div id="wcb" class="carbonbadge"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/website-carbon-badges@1.1.3/b.min.js" defer></script>

In a year with ~120 000 visits bortox produces just ~9kg of CO<sub>2</sub> :balance_scale:
, the equivalent of 4.8kg of pasta :spaghetti: or 75km by car :oncoming_automobile:.

As soon as I have enough money, I will adopt a tree for the sake of the environment and the people but also to offset CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

### Reducing internet traffic consumption :zap:

bortox applies the most modern techniques to ensure fast and smooth navigation on the device with light pages :feather:.

* Code minification.
* Service worker for caching -> Possibility of offline browsing.
    * Preloading of articles and related posts.
* Server-side caching with nginx.
* Compression of images.
* Use of vector formats such as .svg for icons.

Such techniques make **navigation more ethical** because the smoothness of the site is not overly dependent on device and/or network performance.

## No advertising :no_entry:

bortox is not a website for-profit site despite the monthly visits. 
Navigation remains fast and light also because of the absence of advertisements.

## Confidentiality of visitors' data :eyes:

bortox complies with the GDPR and the only analytics (visit statistics) solution used is GoatCounter (hosted in Europe); it **complies with the GDPR** and is set up to **not collect personal information** that would allow a visitor to be identified, such as their IP address.

The only information stored on a visitor's device by the bortox website are those:

* Dark/light theme preference in local storage.
* Cache of pages already visited so they are accessible offline for 1 hour after the first visit.

More information about privacy in the [Privacy Policy]({{< ref "/privacy" >}})

## Everyone can collaborate :busts_in_silhouette:

Everyone can see the source code of the website and create a [_pull request_](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) after _forking_ the code.

If you are not familiar with _git repos_, the **easiest way** to **propose a change** is to fill out the form ["_Propose a change_"](https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici/proponi-modifica.html).

To **report an error** instead, just fill out the form ["_Report an Error_"](https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici/segnala-errore.html).

Both forms are in :it: Italian but soon they'll be translated in :uk: English.
