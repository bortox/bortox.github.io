## Chapter 9 

In his envelope, Dr. Jekyll writes about his story. He was a serious, respected, hard-working doctor, but he was bored, and he wanted to make his fun-loving side emerge, to bring a little of fun to his dull life. He created a Drug to separate these two characters, it required a double dose to become Hyde and a dose to become Jekyll. Time passed, things changed. Hyde's side became stronger, a double dose was required to become Jekyll, and, after a rest, Jekyll always became Hyde. The Drug left was not enough to transform again Hyde in Jekyll. So, as Hyde, he wrote his servants to find chemicals for new doses of Drug. Servants brought him the listed chemicals, but they didn't work. The glass of water to Drink became purple, and not green. In Hyde's body, he thought that there was something unknown, some ingredient that went into the Drug by accident, that made it effective. So, he couldn't come back to his normal form. The wanted Hyde didn't want to live in prison and die from the cops, so he poisoned himself, and he brought the life on unhappy Jekyll to an end.
