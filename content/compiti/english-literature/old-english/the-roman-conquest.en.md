Julius Caesar was the first Roman emperor to conquer Britain, although only nominally in **55 B.C.**.

The main reasons were two:

1. Britain had a good soil to farm.
2. Celts were helping Gauls, and they had to be taught a lesson

He didn't tryhard and did this just to scare the Celts from helping Gauls, so he failed and lost.

Emperor Claudius, about ~90 years later, in 43 A.D.,  took control of **central and south eastern Britain**.

## Roman influence and politics

Claudius involved Celts in Roman politics, by giving them Roman citizenship. Romans built a n network of roads, terms, temples, theathers, houses and also some words from Latin, e.g. *castra*, merged into the Old English vocabulary. However, latin was used only by the upper class, and didn't replace the Celtic language.

*Castra* is the word for *encampment* and it's easily found in English cities' names, like Manchester, which probably was a *castra* of a man.

## Hadrian's wall

Since they were mainly settled in Wales and Scotland, Hadrian emperor, in 122 A.D. built a great **wall**, to **protect from hostile tribes**, as Picts and Scots, and **mark the empire's border**.

## The Roman withdrawal

The Romans withdrew from Britain in 410, after four centuries of *romanisation* and coexisting with Celts. 

The causes of their leave are many, but the most remarkable ones are the **Sack of Rome**, and an enormous wave of **barbarians invading the empire**.
