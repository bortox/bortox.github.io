* bortox.it **works also offline**. 

## How does bortox.it work offline?

Since bortox.it is a PWA (Progressive Web App) it can be partly browsed even offline! Every page you visit online is stored for one hour in the browser's cache.

![Bortox.it come PWA](/pwa.png)

Every time you visit a webpage on bortox.it, a _service worker_ copies temporarily on the device:

* the page you are visiting
* the pages linked in the page you are visiting

## Available offline pages (if you visited):

* Go to [:house: menu](https://bortox.it/)
* Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://bortox.it/galleria/"> the collection of photos 📷</a>
* Go to [the blog (:it:,:uk:)]({{< ref "/article" >}})
* Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://bortox.it/Compiti-scolastici/">Compiti e appunti scolastici (🇮🇹)</a>
* Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://bortox.it/trovaparadigmi/">🔍 Trovaparadigmi GUI (🇮🇹)</a>

Enjoy your offline surfing!
