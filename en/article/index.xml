If fastboot.zip available: $ fastboot update divested-version-date-dos-device-fastboot.zip If recovery.img available: $ fastboot flash recovery divested-version-date-dos-device-recovery.img
I downloaded both files to install DivestOS the fastboot way, but with my Fairphone 3 it didn&amp;rsquo;t work

Why convert images to modern formats? # Why did I do it? Mainly for three reasons:
The score of some pages with many images on PageSpeed was sometimes less than 90/100 and it mildly infuriated me, because the website average is 98/99 out of 100.</description></item><item><title>Optimize png images with pngquant</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/article/optimize-png-pngquant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/article/optimize-png-pngquant/</guid><description>Surfing on F-droid - an open-source app store - I discovered the Atomize app. This app aims to reduce the size of an image in png format, often by up to 70%.
In my case, using a few screenshots or manga scans, the reduction often reaches 50% with negligible (unnoticeable) losses in image quality.
I was amazed, so I opened the About app screen where I discovered that the app is simply a front-end of the open-source binary pngquant.</description></item><item><title>Show page visitor count on Hugo static site with Congo theme and Goatcounter analytics</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/article/add-page-views-hugo-goatcounter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 09:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/article/add-page-views-hugo-goatcounter/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll use the Goatcounter json api to get the current page views for each article in my hugo static site, and show views in the article meta, in this case next to the reading time, or just below, as you can see.

Fail2ban is a Python service to ban IPs that try to access your server by reading the access logs, as SSH log, Nginx log by using regular expressions to catch malicious IPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Long story short, there were about ~800 failed SSH login attempts, and the rising number annoyed me, so I decided to allow only SSH access with asymmetric key pairs and disallow authentication with passwords to be a bit safer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Create a Discord Webhook and send messages with Python</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/article/discord-webhook/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 14:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/article/discord-webhook/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article I will expose the fastest method to create a Discord webhook, that is a link that can be used with Python to send messages in specific channels of a server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Install Ruby and Jekyll on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/article/ruby-open-suse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 15:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/article/ruby-open-suse/</guid><description>&lt;p>OpenSuse is a distro that I can recommend.
