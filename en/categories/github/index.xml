Why convert images to modern formats? #Why did I do it? Mainly for three reasons:
The score of some pages with many images on PageSpeed was sometimes less than 90/100 and it mildly infuriated me, because the website average is 98/99 out of 100. After enabling webp conversion on my Hugo blog I noticed a better loading speed and savings on bandwidth and image size.</description></item></channel></rss>
