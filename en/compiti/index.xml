Some of those who influenced these changes were women writers and among these, two key figures were Vera Brittain and Virginia Woolf.&lt;/p&gt;

In the preface of the lyrical ballads he wrote his concept of poetry. In the preface Wordsworth wrote that he was going to deal with low and rustic life, as a man speaking to men, wanting to be understood by the other people. Coleridge, on the other way, was thinking about producing poetry by using the power of giving the interest of novelty by modifying colors of imaginations. Rediscovery of middle ages, supernatural, importance of the sublime are respected by Coleridge using imaginary scenery in his works.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Brief summary of Shakespeare's Macbeth</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/macbeth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 10:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/macbeth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s main source for the tragedy Macbeth was Raphael Holinshed&amp;rsquo;s Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some critics the tragedy may have been commissioned by the monarch James II, the successor of Elizabeth the I. He was Scottish, he liked magics and he was intrested in everything connected with magicians and witchcraft, on which he also wrote a book. Macbeth is a tragedy and this tragedy is set in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gulliver's Traverls by Jonathan Swift</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/gulliver-travels/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 10:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/gulliver-travels/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gulliver&amp;rsquo;s travels was published anonimously in 1726, it consisted of four books, because Gulliver undertakes four voyages in the story. There is a book for each voyage. The protagonist belongs to the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is considered a travel book because Gulliver undertakes four differendt voyages, people liked stories about exotic places that were different from England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the protagonist is Lemuel Gulliver, and the book cannot be forced into a single genre. For some critics it is a travel book, for others a children&amp;rsquo;s book,&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Anglo-Saxon period, Gregory I, Alfred the Great and the Normans</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-anglo-saxon-history/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 17:41:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-anglo-saxon-history/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Anglo-Saxon period seems like a long and boring era, but it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely, luckily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting epic poems such as &lt;strong&gt;Beowulf&lt;/strong&gt; and elegies as &lt;strong&gt;Deor&amp;rsquo;s Lament&lt;/strong&gt;, this is the &lt;strong&gt;incipit of English Literature&lt;/strong&gt;, where it all starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After romanised Celts were left alone by the Roman withdrawal, several Germanic tribes invaded Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jutes, Angles and Saxons A.K.A. &lt;strong&gt;Anglo-saxons&lt;/strong&gt; invaded Britain and settled southern of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not going to talk about the early stages of the Anglo-saxon society much, since we&amp;rsquo;ll spend more time on the &lt;strong&gt;Beowulf&lt;/strong&gt; poem and the Norman invasions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Norman Invasion, from William I to Henry II</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:17:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;William, duke of Normady, after winning against Anglo-Saxons gained the &amp;ldquo;Conqueror&amp;rdquo; alias and made drastic changes to the society. He changed the &lt;strong&gt;justice system&lt;/strong&gt;, introducing &lt;strong&gt;sheriffs&lt;/strong&gt; and the feudal system, he also introduced &lt;strong&gt;Norman Rule&lt;/strong&gt; and wrecked the &lt;strong&gt;Anglo-Saxon ruling class&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loyalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical courage (to fight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personal freedom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bravery&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons were two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Britain had a good soil to farm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celts were helping Gauls, and they had to be taught a lesson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;rsquo;t tryhard and did this just to scare the Celts from helping Gauls, so he failed and lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Claudius, about ~90 years later, in 43 A.D., took control of &lt;strong&gt;central and south eastern Britain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Celtic Society</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-celtic-society/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-celtic-society/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the origins of English culture and literature in this page, right from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first inhabitants of British Isles vere the Iberians, many centuries B.C.&lt;/p&gt;

We say "B.C." (Before Christ) or "B.C.E" for events happened before the year 0, and instead "A.D." (Anno Domini) or "C.E." (Common Era) for events happened after the year 0.

 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the Iberians (our book - LitHub - doesn&amp;rsquo;t even talk about them!)
