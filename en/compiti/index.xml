According to some critics the tragedy may have been commissioned by the monarch James II, the successor of Elizabeth the I. He was Scottish, he liked magics and he was intrested in everything connected with magicians and witchcraft, on which he also wrote a book.

Counting epic poems such as Beowulf and elegies as Deor&amp;rsquo;s Lament, this is the incipit of English Literature, where it all starts.
After romanised Celts were left alone by the Roman withdrawal, several Germanic tribes invaded Britain.
Jutes, Angles and Saxons A.K.A. Anglo-saxons invaded Britain and settled southern of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall.
We&amp;rsquo;re not going to talk about the early stages of the Anglo-saxon society much, since we&amp;rsquo;ll spend more time on the Beowulf poem and the Norman invasions.</description></item><item><title>The Norman Invasion, from William I to Henry II</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:17:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/</guid><description>William, duke of Normady, after winning against Anglo-Saxons gained the &amp;ldquo;Conqueror&amp;rdquo; alias and made drastic changes to the society. He changed the justice system, introducing sheriffs and the feudal system, he also introduced Norman Rule and wrecked the Anglo-Saxon ruling class.

Since Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:
loyalty physical courage (to fight) personal freedom bravery The King # The king, at the top of the society, had its own group of warriors, the thanes, bound by loyalty to him - the most important value. King and thanes togheter form the comitatus.
