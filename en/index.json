Some of those who influenced these changes were women writers and among these, two key figures were Vera Brittain and Virginia Woolf.\nSuffragists and suffragettes #Suffragists asked for their rights in a peaceful way, while suffragettes used also violence to intervene in the political scene and raise awareness about women conditions.\nReflect on where do you draw the line beetween a violent and a non-violent demonstration? What is suffrage? #Suffrage is the right by law to vote in national or local elections. To get a gist on suffrage demonstrations, you can watch videos from Britannica\nWomen Suffrage Advocates #In Great Britain woman suffrage was first advocated by Mary Wollstonecraft in her book A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) and was demanded by the Chartist movement of the 1840s. The demand for woman suffrage was increasingly taken up by prominent liberal intellectuals in England from the 1850s on, notably by John Stuart Mill and his wife, Harriet Taylor. The first woman suffrage committee was formed in Manchester in 1865, and in 1867 Mill presented to Parliament this society\u0026rsquo;s petition, which demanded the vote for women and contained about 1,550 signatures.\nLaws about suffrage #The Reform Bill of 1867 contained no provision for woman suffrage, but meanwhile woman suffrage societies were forming in most of the major cities of Britain, and in the 1870s these organizations submitted to Parliament petitions demanding the franchise (right to vote) for women and containing a total of almost three million signatures. Even though as of now we know that many of John Stuart Mill\u0026rsquo;s works were written by his wife Harriet, her role is not highlighted in this text.\nDuring that period, a women couldn\u0026rsquo;t publish politics essays and be taken seriously: because of that, even now her name isn\u0026rsquo;t as known as Mill\u0026rsquo;s.\nThe succeeding years saw the defeat of every major suffrage bill brought before Parliament. This was chiefly because neither of the leading politicians of the day, William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli, cared to affront Queen Victoria\u0026rsquo;s implacable opposition to the women\u0026rsquo;s movement.\nIn 1869, however, Parliament did grant women taxpayers the right to vote in municipal elections, and in the ensuing (successive) decades women became eligible (entitled) to sit on county and city councils. The right to vote in parliamentary elections was still denied to women, however, despite the considerable support that existed in Parliament for legislation to that effect.\nBirth of the suffragettes #In 1897 the various suffragist societies united into one National Union of Women\u0026rsquo;s Suffrage Societies, thus bringing a greater degree of coherence and organization to the movement. Out of frustration at the lack of governmental action, however, a segment of the woman suffrage movement became more militant under the leadership of Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel.\nDeeds, not words Motto of the suffragettes\nAfter the return to power of the Liberal Party in 1906, the succeeding years saw the defeat of seven suffrage bills in Parliament. As a consequence, many suffragists became involved in increasingly violent actions as time went on. These women militants, or suffragettes, as they were known, were sent to prison and continued their protests there by engaging in hunger strikes. World War I as a turning point #Meanwhile, public support of the woman suffrage movement grew in volume, and public demonstrations, exhibitions, and processions were organized in support of women\u0026rsquo;s right to vote. When World War I began, the woman suffrage organizations shifted their energies to aiding the war effort, and their effectiveness did much to win the public wholeheartedly to the cause of woman suffrage.\nWomen effort in WWI was recognised by the public opinion and most members of parliament from all the major parties.\nThe British Government was the first to recognize women\u0026rsquo;s importance in WWI and allow them to sit in the parliament.\nThe need for the enfranchisement (🇮🇹 concessione del voto) of women was finally recognized by most members of Parliament from all three major parties, and the resulting Representation of the People Act was passed by the House of Commons in June 1917 and by the House of Lords in February 1918. Under this act, all women age 30 or over received the complete franchise. An act to enable women to sit in the House of Commons was enacted shortly afterward. In 1928 the voting age for women was lowered to 21 to place women voters on an equal footing with male voters.\n","date":"Mon, Mar 18, 2024","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/voting-rights-suffragettes-suffragists/","section":"Compiti ed Appunti Scolastici","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe 1900s saw dramatic changes in attitudes and legislation regarding women.

The fictitious name of the novel is Coke Town, Coke is a type of coal which was mined in the main setting, the industrial town. Hard Times is a Bildungsroman, a novel of formation.\nTher are lots of plots sewed togheter in this novel, a main plot cohabiting with many subplots. It was published in 1894, in three books:\nThe sow The reaping The garnering Conflict between emotions and facts as the conflict between workers and owners. #Gradgrind, the portmanteau of “to grind”, which means turning a material into a fine powder and also working hard in order to get success and “grade”, which means. Grind refers also to the intention of Mr. Gradgrind, who wants to grind the minds of their students with facts, not with fancy.\nGradgrind is the owner of a school where the utilitarianism is applied into education. Jeremy Bentham, an Englishman, is one of the main philosophers adhering to utilitarianism. Gradgrind applies the utilitarian philosophy, severely suppressing every form of imagination and creativity is abolished, this philosophy he applies it at also home to Thomas and Luisa, his children. Luisa marries Joshua Bounderby, while being not in love with him, thirty years older than her, in order to get her brother Tom a job in the factory, as a clark. Sissy Jupe develops a strong affection for her strong adopted family.\nJames Hearthouse, a handsome ambitious politician tries to seduce Luisa using facts, who asks Gradgrind for help, collapsing once he comes back to the house. Gradgrind realizes he can’t provide help only using facts.\nMr. Bounderby is the factory owner and banker, Gradgrind and Bounderby are the rich part of the society, thus they profit from applied utilitarianism, Bounderby is the businessman who exploits the workers. They are the respectable victorian middle class men, they are interested only in making money and pretending to be respectable.\nSissy Jupe as the impeersonment of change, who was born in a circus. #Sissy Jupe and Steven Blackpool are the counterpart to Bounderby and Gradgrind. Sissy Jupe was abandoned as a child and consequently adopted by Mr. Gradgrind, while Blackpool has a troubled life with an alcoholic wife, he doesn’t join the trade union and he gets fired. They represent the fancy part of the novel, they are part of the poor classes, Sissy is the daughter of a circus player, while Blackpool is a worker. Sissy has a constant affective and kind behaviour, which changes Mr. Gradgrind’s philosophy from utilitarian, believing in educating guys to be the most productive - after all the emotional trouble in his family - to a system which puts on top emotions, life.\nSteven Blackball is a worker who lives in terrible conditions, who is forced to leave the factory and during the story he is accused of robbing Mr. Bumblebee’s Bank, but he is innocent and Tom robbed the bank. Tom accuses another man who commits suicide after not taking part in a strike. When Tom is indicted he escapes the town by applying to the moving circus, he tries to go back to Coke Town but he dies.\nMeaning of names #The name Luisa comes from the German “Ludwig”, famous from the fight, Luisa is a warrior who is fighting between her father’s facts and her own imagination.\nMr. M’Choackumchild means “Mr choke a child”, a figurative image for the way of teaching used in the schools, to suffocate the students’ creativity. The public schools were private and open to everyone who paid the tuition fees. Ragged schools had classrooms with tiny windows, who hosted often 60 to 70 students per teacher per class.\nSissy is a nickname for Cecilia, a nickname for “Sister”, Cecilia becomes an adoptive sister for Luisa and Thomas.\nDickens’s idea of education #Dickens wanted children to be creative, he believed that education was an important tool to eradicate poverty, he believed that education could rescue children from poverty, we have lots of examples from our days, such as Malala’s speech at the UN, who believed a book to be important. Mary Shelley’s mother believed that education was important for women’s empowerment. If a person can understand what he reads, he has his own critical thinking, important in order to not be manipulated, same as 1984. In Oliver Twist he attacks the workhouse, where children were divided by fathers who were divided by mothers, they could meet at meals but they couldn’t talk. Dickens wants to tell the reader the dangers of industrialisation, which was transofrming human beings into machines, this metamorphosis is evident in the description of Coke Town. Oliver tells us also that life without feelings and emotions is unbearable. Education is important for children and workers, Blackpool is not a literate man, if the workers have had a full education maybe they would’ve improved their condition. Italian writer Alessandro Manzoni believed also in this sentence, and tried to induce a patriotic feeling inside Italy by founding schools and educating the lower classes.\n","date":"Thu, Oct 12, 2023","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/hard-times/","section":"Compiti ed Appunti Scolastici","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHard Times is a long novel set in the north of England, wrote by Charles Dickens.

The Fastboot update is the simplest method, but if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, you can just do like this user:\nI couldn’t find helpful advice on the internet, so I went ahead and sideloaded copy-partitions and DivestOS using the already-in-place LineageOS-Recovery (as there was no specific DivestOS Recovery available for FP3). As (probably) expected, the update package signature couldn`t be verified. After sideloading, I went back to bootloader and followed the instructions about flashing the custom AVB-keys.\nStep by step guide on how to install DivestOS on the FP3 #If you have already unlocked the bootloader and the fastboot commands don\u0026rsquo;t work, you can install DivestOS in this way:\nYou can try the commands to install DivestOS in fastboot anyway but they don\u0026rsquo;t work on every device.\nIf fastboot.zip available: $ fastboot update divested-version-date-dos-device-fastboot.zip If recovery.img available: $ fastboot flash recovery divested-version-date-dos-device-recovery.img\nHowever the ROM can be installed also following the steps in the list, which I first did on my FP3 and then wrote about those here.\nReboot to recovery (use volume buttons to navigate if on or key combination if off) Fairphone doesn\u0026rsquo;t have firmware enabled so: $ adb sideload copy-partitions-device.zip (in my case copy-partitions-fp3-release.zip, the signature verification will fail) Then install DivestOS via sideload: $ adb sideload divested-version-date-dos-device.zip (the signature verification will fail and if you have an OS version older than the DivestOS version it will ask if you want to downgrade your system. Prompt \u0026ldquo;YES\u0026rdquo; to the \u0026ldquo;install anyway?\u0026rdquo; forms.) This will take long, after step 1/2 you\u0026rsquo;ll need to wait about five minutes for the installation. While still in the recovery perform a factory reset. Reboot to fastboot, then enter the following two commands for :TODO understanding what this does. signature-related things. You can enable ADB in the recovery and then send adb reboot bootloader $ fastboot erase avb_custom_key $ fastboot flash avb_custom_key avb_pkmd-fp3.bin Reboot into DivestOS. Warning: If it takes more than 10 minutes to boot something is wrong. Do not let it sit for more than 10 minutes!. In my case the reboot took about two minutes at most. Things that went wrong: After reboot DivestOS couldn\u0026rsquo;t drop down the notification bar and had only the back button (triangle) without the home (circle) and the opened apps (square) ones. Installed the latest update and while preparing for the update the other buttons appeared.\n","date":"Mon, Aug 22,

over 100 articles, mainly Compiti Scolastici (🇮🇹 School assignments), where I also convert images to the recent .avif and .webp formats.\nWhy convert images to modern formats? #Why did I do it? Mainly for three reasons:\nThe score of some pages with many images on PageSpeed was sometimes less than 90/100 and it mildly infuriated me, because the website average is 98/99 out of 100. After enabling webp conversion on my Hugo blog I noticed a better loading speed and savings on bandwidth and image size. It\u0026rsquo;s better for who uses the website too! This article about the obesity crisis (🇬🇧) of the web convinced me to reduce the page size of bortox.it. Images were the biggest problem. How to convert images to webp and avif on Jekyll #I would venture to say that on Jekyll we almost have \u0026lsquo;ready-made food\u0026rsquo; (🇮🇹 common saying) as an excellent plugin comes to our rescue: Jekyll Picture Tag, which enables both responsive images and conversion to more modern formats.\nResponsive images #For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, when images on a site are responsive, several copies of each image are produced in different sizes (e.g. 200x, 400x, 800x, 1200x) and depending on the user\u0026rsquo;s screen, the appropriate ones will be requested by the device.\nFor example, one of my customers on an IPhone may receive an image 400 pixels wide, while another on a laptop will receive one 1200 pixels wide, as he has a wider screen. In this way the loading of images is \u0026lsquo;smarter\u0026rsquo; and also faster without having a penalty on image quality.\nHow to install Jekyll Picture Tag #To install Jekyll Picture Tag just add to the Gemfile the gem jekyll_picture\\tag in the group jekyll_plugins.\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do gem \u0026#39;jekyll_picture_tag\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;~\u0026gt; 2.0\u0026#39; end Next the module is installed, but now we need to configure it.\nHow to configure Jekyll Picture Tag #To configure the Jekyll Picture Tag module, create the file _data/picture.yml.\nFirst, in the file you must specify the media queries set on the site.\nmedia_queries: mobile: \u0026#39;max-width: 600px\u0026#39; laptop: \u0026#39;max-width: 800px\u0026#39; wide: \u0026#39;min-width: 801px\u0026#39; On my site, a device is considered a smartphone if the screen is less than 600 pixels wide, a laptop less than 800px and something else if it is more than 800 pixels wide. I then changed some default parameters:\nformats: [avif, webp, original] # Order matters! format_quality: jpg: 80 png: 85 webp: 75 avif: 70 widths: [200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600] # Image widths, in pixels. I set support for conversion to avif, webp and the original format of files, and different qualities for each format.\nHow to choose the quality of converted images? #Normally 75 is a good number for the quality of converted images and is used by default by Hugo, the framework for building static sites like this one from Google. On the official site of the conversion to .avif (https://avif.io/) the default is 70, evaluating these parameters I would recommend keeping in the 70 to 80 range for image quality.\nFor further customisation of picture.yml, I recommend referring to the documentation of Jekyll Picture Tag, available at https://rbuchberger.github.io/jekyll_picture_tag/\nIncrease build time in exchange for smaller images #image_options: avif: compression: av1 effort: 7 # Up to 9 from 0, 9=really slow png: compression: 9 # Up to 9, fast webp: effort: 5 # Up to 6 from 0, 4=default With these options the effort of image conversion increases to over 100%, for savings of 5-10%. Avif takes like 10 times the time of webp conversion and webp takes longer than png.\nIf you build locally and as written below and you remove the JPT converted images folder from the .gitignore it can be an effective idea for better compression, else the build times are too high and leave the default.\nMore informations in JPT Documentation (🇬🇧) and on libvips API Documentation (🇬🇧) on image compression options.\nTesting Jekyll Picture Tag #As the name implies, Jekyll Picture Tag is a tag liquid, so it is added to pages in Markdown more or less like this {% tag %}.\nRegex to convert Markdown Images in Jekyll Picture Tags #If you use VSCodium like I do, or any tool that supports regex, this is a great command for converting ![Alt text](/data/image.png) images into picture tags {% picture /data/image --alt Alt text %}.\nFind: !\\[(.*?)\\]\\((.*?)\\)\\) Replace: {% picture $2 --alt $1 %} If you have a picture that uses liquid code like I do, e.g. ![Picture of test tubes]({{ \u0026quot;/data/img/chemistry/lss/acids-and-bases/provetteac.jpg\u0026quot; | relative_url }}) you have to remove it, because Jekyll Picture Tag needs a path to an existing file from the project root. The exemplary result should be {% picture /data/img/chemistry/lss/acids-and-bases/provetteac.jpg --alt Picture of test tubes %}. With some find \u0026amp; replace you get there. Jekyll Picture Tag dependencies #Jekyll Picture Tag uses libvips to process pictures, along with imagemagick.\nOn Ubuntu, just install libvips-tools. On Alpine the package is called vips, on Debian Buster with YunoHost (my previous setup) don\u0026rsquo;t even think about it: a hell of a lot of dependencies like obsolete meson to compile and reinstall, libvips, imagemagick\u0026hellip; However it was luckily easy to setup Github Actions!\nHow to use Jekyll Picture Tag with Github Actions #Fortunately this time help is in the documentation but it\u0026rsquo;s no good. Since the system is Ubuntu, the repos don\u0026rsquo;t yet have the lipvips version that supports avif - as of 2022/07/20 -, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use an Arch-based system, whose repos get updates very quickly.\nname: Build and Deploy to Github Pages on: push: branches: - master # Here source code branch is `master`, it could be other branches jobs: build_and_deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Use GitHub Actions\u0026#39; cache to cache dependencies on servers - uses: actions/cache@v1 with: path: vendor/bundle key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${ hashFiles(\u0026#39;**/Gemfile.lock\u0026#39;) }} restore-keys: | ${ runner.os }}-gems-. # Use GitHub Deploy Action to build and deploy to Github - uses: jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action@v0.4.0 with: provider: \u0026#39;github\u0026#39; token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # It\u0026#39;s your Personal Access Token(PAT) pre_build_commands: pacman -S --noconfirm libvips imagemagick openjpeg2 libheif poppler libjxl libwebp libpng libjpeg-turbo repository: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is current repository branch: \u0026#39;gh-pages\u0026#39; # Default is gh-pages for github provider jekyll_src: \u0026#39;./\u0026#39; # Default is root directory jekyll_cfg: \u0026#39;_config.yml\u0026#39; # Default is _config.yml jekyll_baseurl: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is using _config.yml bundler_ver: \u0026#39;\u0026gt;=0\u0026#39; # Default is latest bundler version cname: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is to not use a cname actor: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is the GITHUB_ACTOR This is the build file that works for the setup just shown, just create a token with permission to write to the repos (specifically to the gh-pages branch), set the branch on which a push will enable the action (in my case, master) and add the imagemagick libvips and libs to support different formats like libheif installation to the pre_build_commands (pacman -S \u0026ndash;noconfirm libvips imagemagick openjpeg2 libheif poppler libjxl libwebp libpng libjpeg-turbo).\nAll of those libraries in the pre_build_commands are required for different things:\nlibvips -\u0026gt; necessary imagemagick -\u0026gt; necessary openjpeg2 -\u0026gt; jp2 support, format for old apple devices instead of webp libheif -\u0026gt; avif support, modern format poppler -\u0026gt; svg support libjxl -\u0026gt; jpegxl support, royalty-free format sometimes better than webp/avif.

In my case it was already present in the Arch repos, so just run pacman -S pngquant, otherwise for those using Windows or Mac-OS other download possibilities, even some GUIs are listed on the pngquant site.\nUse pngquant from the command line #``bash pngquant \u0026ndash;skip-if-larger \u0026ndash;speed 1 \u0026ndash;ext .png \u0026ndash;force -Q 92-100 $(find . -name \u0026lsquo;*.png\u0026rsquo;)\nUpdate: this is better because it can use multiple cores, -P8 is the number of CPUs: ```bash find . -name \u0026#39;*.png\u0026#39; -print0 | xargs -0 -P8 -L1 pngquant --ext .png --force -Q 92-100 --skip-if-larger I have run this command to compress my images, obtaining good results, often reductions of more than 50% of the original size.\n--skip-if-larger If the resulting file is larger than the original one, then it is not saved.\nspeed 1 the compression speed is a number between 1 and 11, 1 is the value that ensures a slow but effective compression, 11 on the other hand generates a fast but worse compression ratio, e.g. the resulting file will be larger. 4 is the default value of the speed parameter if not specified.\n-Q 92-100 sets the minimum and maximum quality. If the quality is less than the minimum value - in my case 92 - the file is not saved. On the other hand, if the quality exceeds the maximum value, then fewer colours will be used to compress the file more effectively. This range is rather high, for a website even -Q 70-85 would suffice, as the priority is to reduce the file size, not the detail in the photos.\n--ext .png --force This part overwrites the processed images (I use git, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem for me) if you want to avoid it, remove the \u0026ndash;force suffix or change the extension (i.e. the file suffix) to e.g. --ext compressed.png.\n$(find . -name '*.png') This code expression uses the find command. In this case, it finds all files ending in .png in the current folder (.) and subfolders, producing a list which is read by the pngquant command. Instead of using $(find . -name '*.png'), with *.png only the png files in the current directory are processed. If you want to convert a single file you just have to write the filename at the end of the command.\nSources: # pngquant -h man pngquant Stackoverflow question on usage for subdirectories Pngquant website Atomize F-Droid page ","date":"Tue, Jul 19, 2022","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/article/optimize-png-pngquant/","section":"Welcome on BBlog","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSurfing on F-droid - an open-source app store - I discovered the Atomize app. This app aims to \u003cstrong\u003ereduce the size of an image in png format\u003c/strong\u003e, often by up to 70%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my case, using a few screenshots or manga scans, the reduction often reaches 50% with negligible (unnoticeable) losses in image quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was amazed, so I opened the \u003cem\u003eAbout app\u003c/em\u003e screen where I discovered that the app is simply a front-end of the open-source binary \u003ca href=\"https://pngquant.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003epngquant\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Optimize png images with pngquant"},{"content":"Website map #The site (the lair of the Borto) is divided into two sections:\nPerson 😐 School 🎒 :neutral_face: Person #Photo 📷 #The personal section contains a collection of 📷 photos taken by me.

If I have a list of pages in Hugo and want to get the visits for each of them, location.pathname will tell me the path of the current page, not of the pages listed on the current page. Some Hugo magic is needed to make it work also on cateogry and tag pages.\nEdit /layouts/partials/article-meta.html to add partial meta/visit-counter.html Write partial meta/visit-counter.html Edit i18n files to add new titles (optional) Add visit-counter meta to article-meta # This is the article meta, containing page date, word count, reading time and visitor count. I copied the original /layouts/partials/article-meta.html file from the hugo Congo theme that I am using and added the following lines.\n{{ if and (.Params.showVisitCount | default (.Site.Params.article.showVisitCount | default true)) }} {{ $meta.Add \u0026#34;partials\u0026#34; (slice (partial \u0026#34;meta/visit-counter.html\u0026#34; .)) }} {{ end }} These lines basically read:\nIf the showVisitCount parameter is true, show the visit-counter.html partial and add it to $meta.\nIf showVisitCount parameter is not listed, default the condition to true and add visit-counter.html partial to $meta.\nI added the lines before the line with showEdit since I wanted the visit count before the button to edit the page on Github, like this (2115 visite means 2115 visits):\nWrite article-meta.html #\u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;{{ .File.UniqueID }}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;{{ i18n \u0026#34;article.visit_title\u0026#34; }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- \u0026#34;🙈\u0026#34; | markdownify | emojify -}} \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var r = new XMLHttpRequest(); r.addEventListener(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, function() { document.getElementById(\u0026#39;{{ .File.UniqueID }}\u0026#39;).innerText = JSON.parse(this.responseText).count_unique + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + {{ i18n \u0026#34;article.visit_name\u0026#34; }} }) r.open(\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://bortox.goatcounter.com/counter/\u0026#39; + encodeURIComponent({{ .RelPermalink }}.replace(/(\\/)?$/, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;)) + \u0026#39;.json\u0026#39;) r.send() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {{- /* Trim EOF */ -}} Since this meta also apperead on category and tag pages, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;stats\u0026rdquo; as the id of the text to be edited, the id had to be unique for each page.\nSo, I made use of Hugo\u0026rsquo;s functionalities and set as id the {{ .File.UniqueID }} of every page, basically the MD5-checksum of the content file’s path.\nI used .RelPermalink (the relative permanent link for the page) of every page to build the request to Goatcounter API.\nUpdate: I added .replace(/(\\/)?$/, '') to .RelPermalink because Goatcounter was marking pages ending with a slash as not found and registering views for pages without the last slash.\nThere is probably an easier way to do this with cleaner Javascript, if you have some ideas or have to point out that something is not correct, contact me at bortox at bortox dot it. I will add soon commenting functionality, but not with Disqus.\nTranslate related strings with i18n #So we have to translate the span title, which is basically the tooltip of the text, and the visit name.

There is a book for each voyage. The protagonist belongs to the middle class.\nIt is considered a travel book because Gulliver undertakes four differendt voyages, people liked stories about exotic places that were different from England.\nThe name of the protagonist is Lemuel Gulliver, and the book cannot be forced into a single genre. For some critics it is a travel book, for others a children\u0026rsquo;s book,\nThe four travels in Gulliver\u0026rsquo;s travels #People like us may know just the story of the first book, because the film is based on the story of the first travel. He finds himself as a giant in a foreign country, while the inhabitants are tiny people. Apparently, this story seems a story for children, but it is not. The lillipushians seem friendly, but instead they are mildly aggressive, Swift criticizes the politicians of the english society who seem kind but in reality are quite aggressive.\nIn the second book Gulliver finds himself in Brodignak, in this case he is tiny while the inhabitants are giants. They treat him like a toy, a speaking doll, he entertains the king exalting his country, the people and the enterprises of England, but when the king asks him more questions about it what emerges is the heavy corruption in english politics.\nIn the third journey he is in Ollaputa, a floating island, where the inhabitants are musciian, scientists, philosophers, people who have only as ingle interest and aren\u0026rsquo;t pragmatic. The inhabitants have servants to do everyday things for them, in this case there could be a critic to the royal society and the scientists of the period who even made dangerous researches.\nIn the last book, Gulliver is in the land of Whims, the name reminds our professor of the sound of the horses, and the Whims in fact are horses. In this country there are rational and kind horses, the Whims. Gulliver is attracted by the rational standardized society of the horses, what emerges is that they are unable to be sympathetic to the other people, to understand the needs of the other people. The Yahoos are very similar to human beings, they are aggressive, irrational, rude and quite savage. Gulliver doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the Yahoos, at the end of the story Gulliver comes back to England he can\u0026rsquo;t stand living with other people and starts living in the staple with the horses, the Whims.\nHe doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have any relationshiop with mankind. Swift is considered for this an ambigous writer, he was on the side of the poor but at the same time he considered mankind stupid, aggressive and unable to be rational as he wanted people to be.\nIf we search deeply what is beyond the surface we can see that he criticizes English society and politics, with an attack towards mankind.\nThere is a sort of symmetry between the first and second book. Swift is also criticizing the British feeling of superiority towards other people, mainly in the first and second one. In the first book the Lilliputians feel superior because of their feelings, in the second the Brobdingnags feel superior thanks to their size.\nThemes # Pessimism and the limits of human beings attacks on human vanity impractical pedantry corruption and provincialism allegorical dimension: realism vs fantastic situations The fictional places are located in continents that exist, such as Asia. The story pretends to be real, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. The protagonist belongs to the middle class, he can be real, like the places and the way the inhabitants of the imaginary countries act makes them feel real. The style is simple and plain.\nfirst persona narrator simple and plain languagemisanthr sharp satire against humankind: misanthrope (someone who dislikes and avoid other people. Swift too was a misanthrope) against political situation in 18th century realism detailed descriptions and maps matter-of-fact language introductory letters: of the editor and of Gulliver devices of disproportion and alteration (human relationships as well as physical size) Swift is against the was and pro peace, as we can see in a most obstinate war, where thousands of people die just because of an argument on when to break an egg.\n","date":"Sat, Feb 5, 2022","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/gulliver-travels/","section":"Compiti ed Appunti Scolastici","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGulliver\u0026rsquo;s travels was published anonimously in 1726, it consisted of four books, because Gulliver undertakes four voyages in the story.

Fail2ban is a Python service to ban IPs that try to access your server by reading the access logs, as SSH log, Nginx log by using regular expressions to catch malicious IPs.\nLong story short, there were about ~800 failed SSH login attempts, and the rising number annoyed me, so I decided to allow only SSH access with asymmetric key pairs and disallow authentication with passwords to be a bit safer.\nHow SSH Key asymmetric encryption works # You create two keys on your device, one public key and one private key. Your device uses complicated operations with elliptic curves and prime numbers to derive the keys in a secure way.\nAfter the public key is sent to the server, the server uses it to encrypt information.\nThe private key stays on your device, and it can decrypt information encrypted using the public key paired with it.\nTo establish a secure connection, for example, the server encrypts with the public key a challenge message which your device has to decrypt with the paired private key and send back.\nIt is not possible to derive the private key from the public key.\nYou can protect your private key with a password, so everyone who gets the private key file has to first decrypt it with the password you set before.\n1) Create a SSH Key on your device. #ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 1000\nTo know more about this, you can check first GitHub\u0026rsquo;s tutorial, then, for example, this blog post, regarding the differences between SSH key generation algorithms.\n2) Copy the SSH Key on the YunoHost Server. #There are two easy ways.\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your-key-name.pub username@host-domain.com Recommended.

It worked: in the crucial battle of Eddington, Vikings lost against Anglo-Saxons.\nAlfred the Great was very important also for culture: he encouraged building schools and he promoted the writing of Anglo Saxons Chronicles: kind of a book where the most important historical events were written.

He changed the justice system, introducing sheriffs and the feudal system, he also introduced Norman Rule and wrecked the Anglo-Saxon ruling class.\nThe Norman Rule #The Norman Rule deprived Anglo-Saxons of their properties and land and replaced Anglo-Saxon aristocrats with Norman aristocrats, so now the ruling class spoke French.\nBirth of Middle English #If you were there, after William\u0026rsquo;s conquest, you\u0026rsquo;d hear three different languages in Britain:\nFrench, spoke by the court and the new aristocracy Latin, spoke by the clergy Old English, spoke by the people Those three languages blended together and gave birth to Middle English with the beginning of Middle Ages too! The Old English was similar to Latin, with lots of declination. REPHRASE Those declination began to be used less and less, English went on by leaving behind those declinations.\nThe Feudal System #![Image of the Feudal System from my School notes]\nThe feudal system was a way to manage land based on loyalty. In theory.\nThe feudal system is composed of lots of contract between superiors and subordinates.\nEvery contract establishes a bond based on loyalty. The bond was called a Feudal pact.\nIn a Feudal pact the superior lends a piece of land (the feud) to the subordinate and grants him protection against enemies, while the subordinate has to be loyal to the superior, provide miltary support to the superior and manage the feud.\nIf the subordinate is a serf or a peasant he is treated as an object and has to work for free and give the whole harvest to the superior, in exchange for free board and lodging from the superior.\nAbout 90% of the population were \"objects\" at that time This was the hierarchy of the Feudal System at that time\nKing Barons Knights Serfs (peasants) Usually a subordinate was also a superior of someone else, this made the system kind of decentralised and hard to control, Barons (a.k.a. French noblemen) also managed to gain too much power at that time, so Henry I introduced the Sheriff figure.\nThe sheriff represented the king and had judicial power. There were many sheriffs, and their main duties were:\nCheck barons\u0026rsquo; work Raise barons\u0026rsquo; taxes All the contracts between the King and the Barons were held in the Domesday Book. It was introduced in 1086 by order of William I and had the goal to contain holdings and values of rich men.\nThe Norman dinasty #William the Conqueror was succeded by William II, an unpopular king.\nHenry I, who came to power after William II\u0026rsquo;s death, was the first Norman King born in England, but he died at a young age.\nStephen, the next king, was weak and lost land, he was going to die. This is where the trouble begins.\nMatilda, Stephen\u0026rsquo;s sister, claimed the trone for her sons, and married Jeffrey Plantagenet, a powerful French nobleman. A period of fights between Matilda Plantagenet and Stephen began, and the final compromise was signed in Westminster. The Treaty of Westminster allowed Henry II, Matilda\u0026rsquo;s son, to get the trone.\nHenry II #Henry II wanted to control England at he was one of the most powerful figures of Europe at that time.\nIncrease land power #Henry II ruled England and arranging the marriage with Eleonore of Aquitaine he had the rights to rule Northern France, being both a Plantagenet and an Aquitanian.\nIncrease military power #Henry II wanted to reduce potential opponets\u0026rsquo; power, especially he blocked the barons from conjuring against the state by increasing the military power. He empowered the army by introducing the scutage, which changed the Feudal pact.\nThe scutage was a tax imposed on barons and knights by the king. The scutage had to be paid when the taxpayers didn\u0026rsquo;t have to go to war, and with the money flowing in, Henry II employed professional soldiers (mercenaries) for the kingdom\u0026rsquo;s army.\nThe Common Law #Henry II wanted to increase also the kingdom\u0026rsquo;s judicial power so he introduced the Common Law, a law designed to be equal for everyone, everywhere in the Kingdom.\nHe introduced a new figure to control barons, since Sheriffs liked the smell of barons\u0026rsquo; money, the travelling judges.\nTravelling judges had higher judicial authority than sheriffs and barons and travelled around the kingdom.\nDue to distributed protest, the dream of a law applied everywhere in the kingdom was shattered: the Church-owned land, common law was not in use.\nThe conflict with the church #Henry II nominated his former Chancellor, Thomas Beckett, Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest representative of the Catholic Church in England.\nThomas Beckett was probably the only true friend of Henry II, Beckett helped Henry to destroy over 1000 castles of oppositors and was the only one which Henry trusted.\nBeckett didn\u0026rsquo;t belive in God, so he was seen with distrust and disregard by clergymen, even more after he was nominated Archbishop.\nHe changed, and he started to believe. When Henry handed him the Constitution of Clarendon, a document to subject the clergy to common law, Beckett refused, and said that Church and State were two separate authorities.\nHenry was furios and viewed the conversion as a betrayal, so he exiliated Beckett.\nBeckett and Henry started an intense exchange of letters, with Beckett trying to convert Henry and Henry being hostile to Beckett.\nNothing happened, and a few years later they met in [ADD: WHERE] and decided to make peace.\nHowever, one night, the king Henry was attending a meeting with the Barons, and a baron expressed his hatred towards Beckett, [ADD: CITAZIONE]. Henry approved [ADD: CITAZIONE] and immediatly a team of four knights left the room to hunt Beckett. Henry tried to stop them, but it was too late.\nThe Knights arrived to the Cathedral of Canterbury, Beckett let them enter despite the opposition of a priest because \u0026ldquo;the house of God is open to everyone\u0026rdquo;, the knights surrounded him and stabbed him to death. Beckett is known as the first martyr of England because when he was being stabbed he bent his elbows and allegedly said\n\u0026ldquo;For the name of Jesus and the protection of the church I am ready to embrace death.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter Beckett\u0026rsquo;s death Henry II didn\u0026rsquo;t sleep for three nights, then he moved on, but at an old age he died [NON MI RICORDO COSA SUCCEDE MI SEMBRA LO TRADISCA LA MOGLIE ED UNO DEI FIGLI LO UCCIDA]\nNEW DOC\nLollardy Reform #Henry III #Richard I #THE MAN WITH THE PAN\nJohn Lackland #NEWE DOC\nmagna carta #","date":"Tue, Nov 30, 2021","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/","section":"Compiti ed Appunti Scolastici","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWilliam, duke of Normady, after winning against Anglo-Saxons gained the \u0026ldquo;Conqueror\u0026rdquo; alias and made drastic changes to the society.

King and thanes togheter form the comitatus.\nUsually the king also created a mid-hall, like the one we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in Beowulf, which is a large room in the castle, where people joined to celebrate victory and to drink. The main hobbies of Germanic people, were, in fact, feasting and drinking.\nThe most common jobs were artisans, farmers and warriors.\nThe Scop #The word scop comes from the word shape, which is derived from the Old English verb shippam \u0026ldquo;To Create\u0026rdquo;, since the Scop manufactured stories like an artisan creates shapes.\nHe had to tell folks in the mid-hall, traditional stories, orally, since the major slice of the population was illiterate.\nHe was also present in battles, as a commentator and an observer, this way scops managed to record centuries of Old English language, common life and heroic acts.\nThe Scop didn\u0026rsquo;t just tell stories, he also played musical instruments, usually a harp to make the stories easier to recall for the illiterate listeners.\nThe Scop had vocal conscience: he was telling history, but also collecting history.\nThanks to this figure epic poems, such as the Beowulf, survived through centuries, without being written. We find a similar case with the Iliad and the Odyssey, heritages from the Greek oral tradition too.\nAnglo-Saxon Poetry #Poems were usually sang or accompanied by music, tramanded orally by scops. The main themes are\nhistorical events, like invasions, emphasizing bravery and honour of the warriors. pagan sources inspired from the bible Anglo-Saxon poems can be splited in two main genres: Epic poems and Elegies.\nElegies #The main theme of an elegy is the MC\u0026rsquo;s sorrow and solitude, while he is contemplating his loneliness.\nUsually the MC is an exiliated man from his community, he is afraid of remaining alone, he contemplates his loneliness while wandering alone.\nSolitude, according to Germanic logic, is worse than dying for the community.\nEpics #The Beowulf is the most-important Anglo-Saxon epic poem, and it is the only one which survived in old English. The main themes of the Beowulf are bravery, courage and history, both of the hero and of the Danes.\nEpics can be splitted in two types:\nPrimary Epics, first transmitted orally then written down, like the Iliad. Secondary Epics, first written down then chanted, like the Anaeid. Features of Anglo-Saxon poetry #The main features of Anglo-Saxon poetry are three, like Caesura, Allitteration and Kennings.\nCaesura is a pose in the middle of a line, indicated by a punctuation mark. Caesura made the composition more pleasant-sounding and allowed the scop to inhale air.\nAllitteration, repetion of letters and syllabes to give a song-like sound to the poem.\nKennings are unique to Old-English and are made combining two words. For example, the term bone house refers to the skeleton, since the skeleton is the house of bones.\nAnglo-Saxon in daily life #To this day, Anglo-Saxon culture and Old English still is a pillar of English language.\nThe first example is England itself: the name England comes from Engla + land which means land of the Angles. Engla is the genitive case of Angle.\nReading and Birmingham both have germanic origins. The suffix ing refers to a folk family, for example Birmingham probably was the farm (ham) of the Birm family.\nThe etymology of Manchester instead comes from Latin too: Manchester was a castra (military camp) of men.\n","date":"Tue, Oct 5, 2021","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-anglo-saxon-society/","section":"Compiti ed Appunti Scolastici","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Anglo Saxon society had a hierarchical structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eloyalty\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ephysical courage (to fight)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epersonal freedom\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebravery\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-king\" class=\"relative group\"\u003eThe King \u003cspan class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#the-king\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe king, at the top of the society, had its own group of warriors, the \u003cem\u003ethanes\u003c/em\u003e, bound by loyalty to him - the most important value.

However, latin was used only by the upper class, and didn\u0026rsquo;t replace the Celtic language.\nCastra is the word for encampment and it\u0026rsquo;s easily found in English cities\u0026rsquo; names, like Manchester, which probably was a castra of a man.\nHadrian\u0026rsquo;s wall #Since they were mainly settled in Wales and Scotland, Hadrian emperor, in 122 A.D. built a great wall, to protect from hostile tribes, as Picts and Scots, and mark the empire\u0026rsquo;s border.\nThe Roman withdrawal #The Romans withdrew from Britain in 410, after four centuries of romanisation and coexisting with Celts.\nThe causes of their leave are many, but the most remarkable ones are the Sack of Rome, and an enormous wave of barbarians invading the empire.\n","date":"Tue, Oct 5, 2021","permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-roman-conquest/","section":"Compiti ed Appunti Scolastici","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJulius Caesar was the first Roman emperor to conquer Britain, although only nominally in \u003cstrong\u003e55 B.C.\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main reasons were two:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBritain had a good soil to farm.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCelts were helping Gauls, and they had to be taught a lesson\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0026rsquo;t tryhard and did this just to scare the Celts from helping Gauls, so he failed and lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmperor Claudius, about ~90 years later, in 43 A.D.,  took control of \u003cstrong\u003ecentral and south eastern Britain\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Roman Conquest of Britain"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://bortox.it/en/tags/wall/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wall"},{"content":"We\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about the origins of English culture and literature in this page, right from the beginning.\nThe first inhabitants of British Isles vere the Iberians, many centuries B.C.\nWe say \"B.C.\" (Before Christ) or \"B.C.E\" for events happened before the year 0, and instead \"A.D.\" (Anno Domini) or \"C.E.\" (Common Era) for events happened after the year 0.

Fast and stable, European and also easy to customize thanks to YAST.\nIn the first days of use, however, I encountered a problem: I could not install Jekyll, the program written in Ruby that I use to compile most of my static sites.\nArticle image: OpenSuse chameleon compares with Ruby gems including Jekyll Ruby 2.7 -preinstalled- is also used by YaST and other system programs, and for some reason the version distributed with OpenSuse didn\u0026rsquo;t get along very well with the installation of Jekyll and Bundler.\nFortunately, after a bit of research, I found an issue on GitHub, where jcayouette describes exactly how to solve the problem. I\u0026rsquo;ve translated the process into Italian and written it here (even though this is the English version of the post) to make it easier to understand and faster to search, however this is the link to the original tutorial in English.\nHow to install Ruby 3.0 on OpenSuse #Before installing Jekyll, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to install Ruby, and only after Jekyll, as a \u0026ldquo;gem\u0026rdquo; of Ruby, i.e. code that you can include in Ruby projects.\nInstall dependencies ``bash sudo zypper in autoconf libopenssl-devel libyaml-devel readline-devel libxslt-devel ncurses-devel libffi-devel zlib-devel gdbm-devel libgdbm4 ## Install rbenv to handle different versions of Ruby on the same system. * Clone the rbenv repo ``bash git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv Add rbenv to the PATH variable so that the program can be run and initialized automatically. Add these lines to the .bashrc file.\n``bash export PATH=\u0026quot;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\u0026quot; export PATH=\u0026quot;$HOME/usr/local/bin:$PATH\u0026quot; eval \u0026ldquo;$(rbenv init -)\u0026rdquo;\n* Run source on .bashrc to apply changes ```bash source ~/.bashrc Check if the installation was successful. Run the rbenv command and check the output. It should be something like:\n``bash rbenv 1.1.2-61-g585ed84 Usage: rbenv [].\nSome useful rbenv commands are: commands List all available rbenv commands local Set or show the local application-specific Ruby version global Set or show the global Ruby version shell Set or show the shell-specific Ruby version install Install a Ruby version using ruby-build. uninstall Uninstall a specific Ruby version rehash Rehash rbenv shims (run this after installing executables) version Show the current Ruby version and its origin versions List installed Ruby versions which Display the full path to an executable whence List all Ruby versions that contain the given executable\nSee `rbenv help \u0026rsquo; for information on a specific command. For full documentation, see: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme\n## Install Ruby using rbenv * To use the rbenv install command, which simplifies the process of installing new versions of Ruby, you should install ruby-build, installed as a rbenv plugin through git: ``bash git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build Displays the latest stable versions for each Ruby implementation that can be installed. rbenv install -l To see all installable versions, use\nrbenv install -L In this case, we will install version 3.0.2, although after this article is written, this will no longer be the latest stable release, shown with rbenv install -l.\nInstall Ruby 3.0.2 with rbenv ``bash rbenv install 3.0.2\n* Sets the installed Ruby version as default ```bash rbenv global 3.0.2 Checks if Ruby installation was successful. ``bash ruby -v\nThanks to rbenv, the system can live with the installed version, keeping the default one needed, for example, for YaST, so don\u0026#39;t uninstall it. * Install Jekyll ``bash gem install jekyll That\u0026rsquo;s it!

For more in-depth information, see the ubiquitous Wikipedia.\nAd blocking works in a very simple way. A DNS resolver with ad-block included, such as BlahDNS, will simply respond to a request for page-with-advertising.co.uk 0.0.0.0, an IP used as a placeholder for an invalid address.\nHow to enable private DNS on Android 9+ #The default DNS resolver server communicates via http, so your requests can be seen by other users in the network, and in particular cases, even manipulated.\nIn order to communicate with an HTTPS server, i.e. with encrypted requests between you and the server, you need to fiddle around a bit, but fortunately from Android 9 onwards it has become very simple: just enable the Private DNS option in the settings.\nHow to enable private DNS in Android settings](/blog/tutorialaldnsprivato.png \u0026ldquo;How to enable private DNS in Android settings\u0026rdquo;)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to do it:\nOpen the Settings app. Click on Network and Internet.
