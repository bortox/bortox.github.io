The Fastboot update is the simplest method, but if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, you can just do like this user:\nI couldn’t find helpful advice on the internet, so I went ahead and sideloaded copy-partitions and DivestOS using the already-in-place LineageOS-Recovery (as there was no specific DivestOS Recovery available for FP3). As (probably) expected, the update package signature couldn`t be verified. After sideloading, I went back to bootloader and followed the instructions about flashing the custom AVB-keys.\nStep by step guide on how to install DivestOS on the FP3 # If you have already unlocked the bootloader and the fastboot commands don\u0026rsquo;t work, you can install DivestOS in this way:\nYou can try the commands to install DivestOS in fastboot anyway but they don\u0026rsquo;t work on every device.\nIf fastboot.zip available: $ fastboot update divested-version-date-dos-device-fastboot.zip If recovery.img available: $ fastboot flash recovery divested-version-date-dos-device-recovery.img\nHowever the ROM can be installed also following the steps in the list, which I first did on my FP3 and then wrote about those here.\nReboot to recovery (use volume buttons to navigate if on or key combination if off) Fairphone doesn\u0026rsquo;t have firmware enabled so: $ adb sideload copy-partitions-device.zip (in my case copy-partitions-fp3-release.zip, the signature verification will fail) Then install DivestOS via sideload: $ adb sideload divested-version-date-dos-device.zip (the signature verification will fail and if you have an OS version older than the DivestOS version it will ask if you want to downgrade your system. Prompt \u0026ldquo;YES\u0026rdquo; to the \u0026ldquo;install anyway?\u0026rdquo; forms.) This will take long, after step 1/2 you\u0026rsquo;ll need to wait about five minutes for the installation. While still in the recovery perform a factory reset. Reboot to fastboot, then enter the following two commands for :TODO understanding what this does. signature-related things. You can enable ADB in the recovery and then send adb reboot bootloader $ fastboot erase avb_custom_key $ fastboot flash avb_custom_key avb_pkmd-fp3.bin Reboot into DivestOS. Warning: If it takes more than 10 minutes to boot something is wrong. Do not let it sit for more than 10 minutes!. In my case the reboot took about two minutes at most. Things that went wrong: After reboot DivestOS couldn\u0026rsquo;t drop down the notification bar and had only the back button (triangle) without the home (circle) and the opened apps (square) ones.

Mainly for three reasons:\nThe score of some pages with many images on PageSpeed was sometimes less than 90/100 and it mildly infuriated me, because the website average is 98/99 out of 100. After enabling webp conversion on my Hugo blog I noticed a better loading speed and savings on bandwidth and image size. It\u0026rsquo;s better for who uses the website too! This article about the obesity crisis (🇬🇧) of the web convinced me to reduce the page size of bortox.it. Images were the biggest problem. How to convert images to webp and avif on Jekyll # I would venture to say that on Jekyll we almost have \u0026lsquo;ready-made food\u0026rsquo; (🇮🇹 common saying) as an excellent plugin comes to our rescue: Jekyll Picture Tag, which enables both responsive images and conversion to more modern formats.\nResponsive images # For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, when images on a site are responsive, several copies of each image are produced in different sizes (e.g. 200x, 400x, 800x, 1200x) and depending on the user\u0026rsquo;s screen, the appropriate ones will be requested by the device.\nFor example, one of my customers on an IPhone may receive an image 400 pixels wide, while another on a laptop will receive one 1200 pixels wide, as he has a wider screen. In this way the loading of images is \u0026lsquo;smarter\u0026rsquo; and also faster without having a penalty on image quality.\nHow to install Jekyll Picture Tag # To install Jekyll Picture Tag just add to the Gemfile the gem jekyll_picture\\tag in the group jekyll_plugins.\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do gem \u0026#39;jekyll_picture_tag\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;~\u0026gt; 2.0\u0026#39; end Next the module is installed, but now we need to configure it.\nHow to configure Jekyll Picture Tag # To configure the Jekyll Picture Tag module, create the file _data/picture.yml.\nFirst, in the file you must specify the media queries set on the site.\nmedia_queries: mobile: \u0026#39;max-width: 600px\u0026#39; laptop: \u0026#39;max-width: 800px\u0026#39; wide: \u0026#39;min-width: 801px\u0026#39; On my site, a device is considered a smartphone if the screen is less than 600 pixels wide, a laptop less than 800px and something else if it is more than 800 pixels wide. I then changed some default parameters:\nformats: [avif, webp, original] # Order matters! format_quality: jpg: 80 png: 85 webp: 75 avif: 70 widths: [200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600] # Image widths, in pixels. I set support for conversion to avif, webp and the original format of files, and different qualities for each format.\nHow to choose the quality of converted images? # Normally 75 is a good number for the quality of converted images and is used by default by Hugo, the framework for building static sites like this one from Google. On the official site of the conversion to .avif (https://avif.io/) the default is 70, evaluating these parameters I would recommend keeping in the 70 to 80 range for image quality.\nFor further customisation of picture.yml, I recommend referring to the documentation of Jekyll Picture Tag, available at https://rbuchberger.github.io/jekyll_picture_tag/\nIncrease build time in exchange for smaller images # image_options: avif: compression: av1 effort: 7 # Up to 9 from 0, 9=really slow png: compression: 9 # Up to 9, fast webp: effort: 5 # Up to 6 from 0, 4=default With these options the effort of image conversion increases to over 100%, for savings of 5-10%. Avif takes like 10 times the time of webp conversion and webp takes longer than png.\nIf you build locally and as written below and you remove the JPT converted images folder from the .gitignore it can be an effective idea for better compression, else the build times are too high and leave the default.\nMore informations in JPT Documentation (🇬🇧) and on libvips API Documentation (🇬🇧) on image compression options.\nTesting Jekyll Picture Tag # As the name implies, Jekyll Picture Tag is a tag liquid, so it is added to pages in Markdown more or less like this {% tag %}.\nRegex to convert Markdown Images in Jekyll Picture Tags # If you use VSCodium like I do, or any tool that supports regex, this is a great command for converting ![Alt text](/data/image.png) images into picture tags {% picture /data/image --alt Alt text %}.\nFind: !\\[(.*?)\\]\\((.*?)\\)\\) Replace: {% picture $2 --alt $1 %} If you have a picture that uses liquid code like I do, e.g. ![Picture of test tubes]({{ \u0026quot;/data/img/chemistry/lss/acids-and-bases/provetteac.jpg\u0026quot; | relative_url }}) you have to remove it, because Jekyll Picture Tag needs a path to an existing file from the project root. The exemplary result should be {% picture /data/img/chemistry/lss/acids-and-bases/provetteac.jpg --alt Picture of test tubes %}. With some find \u0026amp; replace you get there. Jekyll Picture Tag dependencies # Jekyll Picture Tag uses libvips to process pictures, along with imagemagick.\nOn Ubuntu, just install libvips-tools. On Alpine the package is called vips, on Debian Buster with YunoHost (my previous setup) don\u0026rsquo;t even think about it: a hell of a lot of dependencies like obsolete meson to compile and reinstall, libvips, imagemagick\u0026hellip; However it was luckily easy to setup Github Actions!\nHow to use Jekyll Picture Tag with Github Actions # Fortunately this time help is in the documentation but it\u0026rsquo;s no good. Since the system is Ubuntu, the repos don\u0026rsquo;t yet have the lipvips version that supports avif - as of 2022/07/20 -, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use an Arch-based system, whose repos get updates very quickly.\nname: Build and Deploy to Github Pages on: push: branches: - master # Here source code branch is `master`, it could be other branches jobs: build_and_deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Use GitHub Actions\u0026#39; cache to cache dependencies on servers - uses: actions/cache@v1 with: path: vendor/bundle key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${ hashFiles(\u0026#39;**/Gemfile.lock\u0026#39;) }} restore-keys: | ${ runner.os }}-gems-. # Use GitHub Deploy Action to build and deploy to Github - uses: jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action@v0.4.0 with: provider: \u0026#39;github\u0026#39; token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # It\u0026#39;s your Personal Access Token(PAT) pre_build_commands: pacman -S --noconfirm libvips imagemagick openjpeg2 libheif poppler libjxl libwebp libpng libjpeg-turbo repository: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is current repository branch: \u0026#39;gh-pages\u0026#39; # Default is gh-pages for github provider jekyll_src: \u0026#39;./\u0026#39; # Default is root directory jekyll_cfg: \u0026#39;_config.yml\u0026#39; # Default is _config.yml jekyll_baseurl: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is using _config.yml bundler_ver: \u0026#39;\u0026gt;=0\u0026#39; # Default is latest bundler version cname: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is to not use a cname actor: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Default is the GITHUB_ACTOR This is the build file that works for the setup just shown, just create a token with permission to write to the repos (specifically to the gh-pages branch), set the branch on which a push will enable the action (in my case, master) and add the imagemagick libvips and libs to support different formats like libheif installation to the pre_build_commands (pacman -S \u0026ndash;noconfirm libvips imagemagick openjpeg2 libheif poppler libjxl libwebp libpng libjpeg-turbo).\nAll of those libraries in the pre_build_commands are required for different things:\nlibvips -\u0026gt; necessary imagemagick -\u0026gt; necessary openjpeg2 -\u0026gt; jp2 support, format for old apple devices instead of webp libheif -\u0026gt; avif support, modern format poppler -\u0026gt; svg support libjxl -\u0026gt; jpegxl support, royalty-free format sometimes better than webp/avif.

I copied the original /layouts/partials/article-meta.html file from the hugo Congo theme that I am using and added the following lines.\n{{ if and (.Params.showVisitCount | default (.Site.Params.article.showVisitCount | default true)) }} {{ $meta.Add \u0026#34;partials\u0026#34; (slice (partial \u0026#34;meta/visit-counter.html\u0026#34; .)) }} {{ end }} These lines basically read:\nIf the showVisitCount parameter is true, show the visit-counter.html partial and add it to $meta.\nIf showVisitCount parameter is not listed, default the condition to true and add visit-counter.html partial to $meta.\nI added the lines before the line with showEdit since I wanted the visit count before the button to edit the page on Github, like this (2115 visite means 2115 visits):\nWrite article-meta.html # \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;{{ .File.UniqueID }}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;{{ i18n \u0026#34;article.visit_title\u0026#34; }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- \u0026#34;🙈\u0026#34; | markdownify | emojify -}} \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var r = new XMLHttpRequest(); r.addEventListener(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, function() { document.getElementById(\u0026#39;{{ .File.UniqueID }}\u0026#39;).innerText = JSON.parse(this.responseText).count_unique + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + {{ i18n \u0026#34;article.visit_name\u0026#34; }} }) r.open(\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://bortox.goatcounter.com/counter/\u0026#39; + encodeURIComponent({{ .RelPermalink }}.replace(/(\\/)?$/, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;)) + \u0026#39;.json\u0026#39;) r.send() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {{- /* Trim EOF */ -}} Since this meta also apperead on category and tag pages, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;stats\u0026rdquo; as the id of the text to be edited, the id had to be unique for each page.\nSo, I made use of Hugo\u0026rsquo;s functionalities and set as id the {{ .File.UniqueID }} of every page, basically the MD5-checksum of the content file’s path.\nI used .RelPermalink (the relative permanent link for the page) of every page to build the request to Goatcounter API.\nUpdate: I added .replace(/(\\/)?$/, '') to .RelPermalink because Goatcounter was marking pages ending with a slash as not found and registering views for pages without the last slash.\nThere is probably an easier way to do this with cleaner Javascript, if you have some ideas or have to point out that something is not correct, contact me at bortox at bortox dot it. I will add soon commenting functionality, but not with Disqus.\nTranslate related strings with i18n # So we have to translate the span title, which is basically the tooltip of the text, and the visit name. For example, if I have English language to set up, I\u0026rsquo;ll edit i18n/en.yaml and add the following lines under the article section:\narticle: visit_title: \u0026#34;Page views\u0026#34; visit_name: \u0026#34;visits\u0026#34;","date":"Mon, Jun 13, 2022","permalink":"/en/article/add-page-views-hugo-goatcounter/","section":"Welcome on BBlog","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this tutorial I\u0026rsquo;ll use the Goatcounter json api to get the current page views for each article in my hugo static site, and show views in the article meta, in this case next to the reading time, or just below, as you can see.

There is a book for each voyage. The protagonist belongs to the middle class.\nIt is considered a travel book because Gulliver undertakes four differendt voyages, people liked stories about exotic places that were different from England.\nThe name of the protagonist is Lemuel Gulliver, and the book cannot be forced into a single genre. For some critics it is a travel book, for others a children\u0026rsquo;s book,\nThe four travels in Gulliver\u0026rsquo;s travels # People like us may know just the story of the first book, because the film is based on the story of the first travel. He finds himself as a giant in a foreign country, while the inhabitants are tiny people. Apparently, this story seems a story for children, but it is not. The lillipushians seem friendly, but instead they are mildly aggressive, Swift criticizes the politicians of the english society who seem kind but in reality are quite aggressive.\nIn the second book Gulliver finds himself in Brodignak, in this case he is tiny while the inhabitants are giants. They treat him like a toy, a speaking doll, he entertains the king exalting his country, the people and the enterprises of England, but when the king asks him more questions about it what emerges is the heavy corruption in english politics.\nIn the third journey he is in Ollaputa, a floating island, where the inhabitants are musciian, scientists, philosophers, people who have only as ingle interest and aren\u0026rsquo;t pragmatic. The inhabitants have servants to do everyday things for them, in this case there could be a critic to the royal society and the scientists of the period who even made dangerous researches.\nIn the last book, Gulliver is in the land of Whims, the name reminds our professor of the sound of the horses, and the Whims in fact are horses. In this country there are rational and kind horses, the Whims. Gulliver is attracted by the rational standardized society of the horses, what emerges is that they are unable to be sympathetic to the other people, to understand the needs of the other people. The Yahoos are very similar to human beings, they are aggressive, irrational, rude and quite savage. Gulliver doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the Yahoos, at the end of the story Gulliver comes back to England he can\u0026rsquo;t stand living with other people and starts living in the staple with the horses, the Whims.\nHe doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have any relationshiop with mankind. Swift is considered for this an ambigous writer, he was on the side of the poor but at the same time he considered mankind stupid, aggressive and unable to be rational as he wanted people to be.\nIf we search deeply what is beyond the surface we can see that he criticizes English society and politics, with an attack towards mankind.\nThere is a sort of symmetry between the first and second book. Swift is also criticizing the British feeling of superiority towards other people, mainly in the first and second one. In the first book the Lilliputians feel superior because of their feelings, in the second the Brobdingnags feel superior thanks to their size.\nThemes # Pessimism and the limits of human beings attacks on human vanity impractical pedantry corruption and provincialism allegorical dimension: realism vs fantastic situations The fictional places are located in continents that exist, such as Asia. The story pretends to be real, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. The protagonist belongs to the middle class, he can be real, like the places and the way the inhabitants of the imaginary countries act makes them feel real. The style is simple and plain.\nfirst persona narrator simple and plain languagemisanthr sharp satire against humankind: misanthrope (someone who dislikes and avoid other people. Swift too was a misanthrope) against political situation in 18th century realism detailed descriptions and maps matter-of-fact language introductory letters: of the editor and of Gulliver devices of disproportion and alteration (human relationships as well as physical size) Swift is against the was and pro peace, as we can see in a most obstinate war, where thousands of people die just because of an argument on when to break an egg.\n","date":"Sat, Feb 5, 2022","permalink":"/en/compiti/english-literature/gulliver-travels/","section":"Compitis","summary":"Gulliver\u0026rsquo;s travels was published anonimously in 1726, it consisted of four books, because Gulliver undertakes four voyages in the story.

Fail2ban is a Python service to ban IPs that try to access your server by reading the access logs, as SSH log, Nginx log by using regular expressions to catch malicious IPs.\nLong story short, there were about ~800 failed SSH login attempts, and the rising number annoyed me, so I decided to allow only SSH access with asymmetric key pairs and disallow authentication with passwords to be a bit safer.\nHow SSH Key asymmetric encryption works # You create two keys on your device, one public key and one private key. Your device uses complicated operations with elliptic curves and prime numbers to derive the keys in a secure way.\nAfter the public key is sent to the server, the server uses it to encrypt information.\nThe private key stays on your device, and it can decrypt information encrypted using the public key paired with it.\nTo establish a secure connection, for example, the server encrypts with the public key a challenge message which your device has to decrypt with the paired private key and send back.\nIt is not possible to derive the private key from the public key.\nYou can protect your private key with a password, so everyone who gets the private key file has to first decrypt it with the password you set before.\n1) Create a SSH Key on your device. # ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 1000\nTo know more about this, you can check first GitHub\u0026rsquo;s tutorial, then, for example, this blog post, regarding the differences between SSH key generation algorithms.\n2) Copy the SSH Key on the YunoHost Server. # There are two easy ways.\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your-key-name.pub username@host-domain.com Recommended. This way, the SSH program will automatically copy your public key to a new line in the authorized_keys file in your server user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. This file contains all the public keys used to encrypt the connections.\nAlternatively, using YunoHost\u0026rsquo;s built-in command, we can\ncat ~/.ssh/your-key-name.pub copy the cat output to clipboard login to the server using password authentication sudo yunohost user ssh add-key username your-public-key-pasted-from-clipboard \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Run this script with sudo, I ran it as root and it messed with the .ssh folder and authorized_keys file\u0026rsquo;s permissions, making them belong to the root user.

Now it should ask your SSH Key password you set up before. ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key-name username@host-domain.com\n5) Disable SSH password authentication from YunoHost # sudo yunohost settings set security.ssh.password_authentication -v no\nYunoHost will automatically modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_conf file and restart the daemon.\n6) Yay!

It worked: in the crucial battle of Eddington, Vikings lost against Anglo-Saxons.\nAlfred the Great was very important also for culture: he encouraged building schools and he promoted the writing of Anglo Saxons Chronicles: kind of a book where the most important historical events were written.

He changed the justice system, introducing sheriffs and the feudal system, he also introduced Norman Rule and wrecked the Anglo-Saxon ruling class.\nThe Norman Rule # The Norman Rule deprived Anglo-Saxons of their properties and land and replaced Anglo-Saxon aristocrats with Norman aristocrats, so now the ruling class spoke French.\nBirth of Middle English # If you were there, after William\u0026rsquo;s conquest, you\u0026rsquo;d hear three different languages in Britain:\nFrench, spoke by the court and the new aristocracy Latin, spoke by the clergy Old English, spoke by the people Those three languages blended together and gave birth to Middle English with the beginning of Middle Ages too! The Old English was similar to Latin, with lots of declination. REPHRASE Those declination began to be used less and less, English went on by leaving behind those declinations.\nThe Feudal System # ![Image of the Feudal System from my School notes]\nThe feudal system was a way to manage land based on loyalty. In theory.\nThe feudal system is composed of lots of contract between superiors and subordinates.\nEvery contract establishes a bond based on loyalty. The bond was called a Feudal pact.\nIn a Feudal pact the superior lends a piece of land (the feud) to the subordinate and grants him protection against enemies, while the subordinate has to be loyal to the superior, provide miltary support to the superior and manage the feud.\nIf the subordinate is a serf or a peasant he is treated as an object and has to work for free and give the whole harvest to the superior, in exchange for free board and lodging from the superior.\nAbout 90% of the population were \"objects\" at that time This was the hierarchy of the Feudal System at that time\nKing Barons Knights Serfs (peasants) Usually a subordinate was also a superior of someone else, this made the system kind of decentralised and hard to control, Barons (a.k.a. French noblemen) also managed to gain too much power at that time, so Henry I introduced the Sheriff figure.\nThe sheriff represented the king and had judicial power. There were many sheriffs, and their main duties were:\nCheck barons\u0026rsquo; work Raise barons\u0026rsquo; taxes All the contracts between the King and the Barons were held in the Domesday Book. It was introduced in 1086 by order of William I and had the goal to contain holdings and values of rich men.\nThe Norman dinasty # William the Conqueror was succeded by William II, an unpopular king.\nHenry I, who came to power after William II\u0026rsquo;s death, was the first Norman King born in England, but he died at a young age.\nStephen, the next king, was weak and lost land, he was going to die. This is where the trouble begins.\nMatilda, Stephen\u0026rsquo;s sister, claimed the trone for her sons, and married Jeffrey Plantagenet, a powerful French nobleman. A period of fights between Matilda Plantagenet and Stephen began, and the final compromise was signed in Westminster. The Treaty of Westminster allowed Henry II, Matilda\u0026rsquo;s son, to get the trone.\nHenry II # Henry II wanted to control England at he was one of the most powerful figures of Europe at that time.\nIncrease land power # Henry II ruled England and arranging the marriage with Eleonore of Aquitaine he had the rights to rule Northern France, being both a Plantagenet and an Aquitanian.\nIncrease military power # Henry II wanted to reduce potential opponets\u0026rsquo; power, especially he blocked the barons from conjuring against the state by increasing the military power. He empowered the army by introducing the scutage, which changed the Feudal pact.\nThe scutage was a tax imposed on barons and knights by the king. The scutage had to be paid when the taxpayers didn\u0026rsquo;t have to go to war, and with the money flowing in, Henry II employed professional soldiers (mercenaries) for the kingdom\u0026rsquo;s army.\nThe Common Law # Henry II wanted to increase also the kingdom\u0026rsquo;s judicial power so he introduced the Common Law, a law designed to be equal for everyone, everywhere in the Kingdom.\nHe introduced a new figure to control barons, since Sheriffs liked the smell of barons\u0026rsquo; money, the travelling judges.\nTravelling judges had higher judicial authority than sheriffs and barons and travelled around the kingdom.\nDue to distributed protest, the dream of a law applied everywhere in the kingdom was shattered: the Church-owned land, common law was not in use.\nThe conflict with the church # Henry II nominated his former Chancellor, Thomas Beckett, Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest representative of the Catholic Church in England.\nThomas Beckett was probably the only true friend of Henry II, Beckett helped Henry to destroy over 1000 castles of oppositors and was the only one which Henry trusted.\nBeckett didn\u0026rsquo;t belive in God, so he was seen with distrust and disregard by clergymen, even more after he was nominated Archbishop.\nHe changed, and he started to believe. When Henry handed him the Constitution of Clarendon, a document to subject the clergy to common law, Beckett refused, and said that Church and State were two separate authorities.\nHenry was furios and viewed the conversion as a betrayal, so he exiliated Beckett.\nBeckett and Henry started an intense exchange of letters, with Beckett trying to convert Henry and Henry being hostile to Beckett.\nNothing happened, and a few years later they met in [ADD: WHERE] and decided to make peace.\nHowever, one night, the king Henry was attending a meeting with the Barons, and a baron expressed his hatred towards Beckett, [ADD: CITAZIONE].

We find a similar case with the Iliad and the Odyssey, heritages from the Greek oral tradition too.\nAnglo-Saxon Poetry # Poems were usually sang or accompanied by music, tramanded orally by scops. The main themes are\nhistorical events, like invasions, emphasizing bravery and honour of the warriors. pagan sources inspired from the bible Anglo-Saxon poems can be splited in two main genres: Epic poems and Elegies.\nElegies # The main theme of an elegy is the MC\u0026rsquo;s sorrow and solitude, while he is contemplating his loneliness.\nUsually the MC is an exiliated man from his community, he is afraid of remaining alone, he contemplates his loneliness while wandering alone.\nSolitude, according to Germanic logic, is worse than dying for the community.\nEpics # The Beowulf is the most-important Anglo-Saxon epic poem, and it is the only one which survived in old English. The main themes of the Beowulf are bravery, courage and history, both of the hero and of the Danes.\nEpics can be splitted in two types:\nPrimary Epics, first transmitted orally then written down, like the Iliad. Secondary Epics, first written down then chanted, like the Anaeid. {{ /alert}} Features of Anglo-Saxon poetry # The main features of Anglo-Saxon poetry are three, like Caesura, Allitteration and Kennings.\nCaesura is a pose in the middle of a line, indicated by a punctuation mark. Caesura made the composition more pleasant-sounding and allowed the scop to inhale air.\nAllitteration, repetion of letters and syllabes to give a song-like sound to the poem.\nKennings are unique to Old-English and are made combining two words. For example, the term bone house refers to the skeleton, since the skeleton is the house of bones.\nAnglo-Saxon in daily life # To this day, Anglo-Saxon culture and Old English still is a pillar of English language.\nThe first example is England itself: the name England comes from Engla + land which means land of the Angles. Engla is the genitive case of Angle.\nReading and Birmingham both have germanic origins. The suffix ing refers to a folk family, for example Birmingham probably was the farm (ham) of the Birm family.\nThe etymology of Manchester instead comes from Latin too: Manchester was a castra (military camp) of men.\n","date":"Tue, Oct 5, 2021","permalink":"/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-anglo-saxon-society/","section":"Compitis","summary":"The Anglo Saxon society had a hierarchical structure.\nSince Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:\nloyalty physical courage (to fight) personal freedom bravery The King # The king, at the top of the society, had its own group of warriors, the thanes, bound by loyalty to him - the most important value.
