Why convert images to modern formats? # Why did I do it? Mainly for three reasons:
The score of some pages with many images on PageSpeed was sometimes less than 90/100 and it mildly infuriated me, because the website average is 98/99 out of 100.</description></item><item><title>Optimize png images with pngquant</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/article/optimize-png-pngquant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/article/optimize-png-pngquant/</guid><description>Surfing on F-droid - an open-source app store - I discovered the Atomize app. This app aims to reduce the size of an image in png format, often by up to 70%.
In my case, using a few screenshots or manga scans, the reduction often reaches 50% with negligible (unnoticeable) losses in image quality.
I was amazed, so I opened the About app screen where I discovered that the app is simply a front-end of the open-source binary pngquant.</description></item><item><title>About bortox.it :tada:</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/about-website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/about-website/</guid><description>Website map # The site (the lair of the Borto) is divided into two sections:

According to some critics the tragedy may have been commissioned by the monarch James II, the successor of Elizabeth the I. He was Scottish, he liked magics and he was intrested in everything connected with magicians and witchcraft, on which he also wrote a book. Macbeth is a tragedy and this tragedy is set in Scotland.</description></item><item><title>Yunohost setup SSH key access only for user account</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/article/yunohost-ssh-allow-user-only/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 15:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/article/yunohost-ssh-allow-user-only/</guid><description>&lt;p>After installing YunoHost on my VPS on a few days, I checked &lt;em>fail2ban&lt;/em> logs.

Counting epic poems such as Beowulf and elegies as Deor&amp;rsquo;s Lament, this is the incipit of English Literature, where it all starts.
After romanised Celts were left alone by the Roman withdrawal, several Germanic tribes invaded Britain.
Jutes, Angles and Saxons A.K.A. Anglo-saxons invaded Britain and settled southern of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall.
We&amp;rsquo;re not going to talk about the early stages of the Anglo-saxon society much, since we&amp;rsquo;ll spend more time on the Beowulf poem and the Norman invasions.</description></item><item><title>The Norman Invasion, from William I to Henry II</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:17:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-norman-invasion/</guid><description>William, duke of Normady, after winning against Anglo-Saxons gained the &amp;ldquo;Conqueror&amp;rdquo; alias and made drastic changes to the society. He changed the justice system, introducing sheriffs and the feudal system, he also introduced Norman Rule and wrecked the Anglo-Saxon ruling class.
The Norman Rule # The Norman Rule deprived Anglo-Saxons of their properties and land and replaced Anglo-Saxon aristocrats with Norman aristocrats, so now the ruling class spoke French.

Since Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:
loyalty physical courage (to fight) personal freedom bravery The King # The king, at the top of the society, had its own group of warriors, the thanes, bound by loyalty to him - the most important value. King and thanes togheter form the comitatus.
Usually the king also created a mid-hall, like the one we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in Beowulf, which is a large room in the castle, where people joined to celebrate victory and to drink.</description></item><item><title>The Roman Conquest of Britain</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-roman-conquest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-roman-conquest/</guid><description>Julius Caesar was the first Roman emperor to conquer Britain, although only nominally in 55 B.C..
The main reasons were two:
Britain had a good soil to farm. Celts were helping Gauls, and they had to be taught a lesson He didn&amp;rsquo;t tryhard and did this just to scare the Celts from helping Gauls, so he failed and lost.
Emperor Claudius, about ~90 years later, in 43 A.D., took control of central and south eastern Britain.</description></item><item><title>The Celtic Society</title><link>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-celtic-society/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bortox.it/en/compiti/english-literature/old-english/the-celtic-society/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the origins of English culture and literature in this page, right from the beginning.
