Since Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:
loyalty physical courage (to fight) personal freedom bravery The King #The king, at the top of the society, had its own group of warriors, the thanes, bound by loyalty to him - the most important value. King and thanes togheter form the comitatus.
Usually the king also created a mid-hall, like the one we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in Beowulf, which is a large room in the castle, where people joined to celebrate victory and to drink.</description></item></channel></rss>
