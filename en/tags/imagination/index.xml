In the preface of the lyrical ballads he wrote his concept of poetry. In the preface Wordsworth wrote that he was going to deal with low and rustic life, as a man speaking to men, wanting to be understood by the other people. Coleridge, on the other way, was thinking about producing poetry by using the power of giving the interest of novelty by modifying colors of imaginations. Rediscovery of middle ages, supernatural, importance of the sublime are respected by Coleridge using imaginary scenery in his works.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
